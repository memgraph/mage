///@brief A method that computes the betweenness centrality for nodes of the given graph.

///@param graph Graph for exploration
///@param directed Indicates whether the algorithm is performed on a directed or undirected graph
///@param normalized If true the betweenness values are normalized by dividing the value by the
/// number of pairs of nodes not including the node whose value we normalize. For undirected graph
/// the normalization constant is 2/((n-1)(n-2)), and for directed is 1/((n-1)(n-2)).
