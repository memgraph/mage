/**
 * Grappolo community detection algorithm. Implementation by: https://github.com/Exa-Graph/grappolo
 * This function takes graph and calls a parallel clustering using the Louvain method as the serial template.
 * Depending on the <coloring> variable, instance of a graph algorithm with graph coloring is called. Next three
 * parameters are used for stopping the algorithm. If less than <minGraphSize> nodes are left in the graph, algorithm
 * stops. The algorithm will stop the iterations in the current phase when the gain in modularity is less than
 * <threshold> or <coloringThreshold>, depending on the algorithm type.
 *
 * @param grappoloGraph Grappolo graph instance
 * @param coloring If true, graph coloring is applied
 * @param min_graph_size Determines when multi-phase operations should stop. Execution stops when the coarsened graph
 * has collapsed the current graph to a fewer than `minGraphSize` nodes.
 * @param threshold The algorithm will stop the iterations in the current phase when the gain in modularity is less than
 * `threshold`
 * @param coloringThreshold The algorithm will stop the iterations in the current phase of coloring algorithm when the
 * gain in modularity is less than `coloringThreshold`
 * @return Vector of community indices
