## Memgraph Advanced Graph Extensions :crystal_ball:

This open-source repository contains all available user-defined graph analytics modules and procedures that extend the Cypher query language, written by the team behind Memgraph and its users. You can find and contribute implementations of various algorithms in multiple programming languages, all runnable inside Memgraph. This project aims to give everyone the tools they need to tackle the most challenging graph problems.

### Introduction to query modules with MAGE
Memgraph introduces the concept of [query modules](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/reference-guide/query-modules/),
user-defined procedures that extend the Cypher query language. These procedures are grouped into modules that can be loaded into Memgraph. How to run them can be seen on their official
[documentation](https://docs.memgraph.com/mage/usage/loading-modules).
When started, Memgraph will automatically attempt to load the query modules from all `*.so` and `*.py` files it finds in the default directory defined with flag
[--query-modules-directory](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/reference-guide/configuration/).

### Further reading

# Memgraph compatibility
With changes in Memgraph API, MAGE started to track version numbers. Check out the table below which will tell you compatibility of MAGE with Memgraph versions.
| MAGE version | Memgraph version  |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| >= 1.0       | >= 2.0.0          |
| ^0           | >= 1.4.0 <= 1.6.1 |
## How to install?
There are two options to install MAGE. With [Docker installation](#1-installing-mage-with-docker) you only need Docker.
[To build from source](#2-installing-mage-locally-with-linux-package-of-memgraph)
you will need **Python3**, **Make**, **CMake**, **Clang**, **UUID** and **Rust**. Installation with Docker is easier for quick installation
and smaller development.

## Further steps - Installation
After installation part, you will be ready to query Memgraph and use **MAGE** modules. Make sure to have one of [the querying
platform](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph/).

### 1. Installing MAGE with Docker

#### a) Install MAGE from Docker Hub

> Note: Here you don't need to download Github Memgraph/MAGE repository.

**1.** This command downloads image from Docker Hub and runs Memgraph with **MAGE** algorithms:
```
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-mage
```


#### b) Install MAGE with Docker build of repository

**0.** Make sure that you have cloned MAGE Github repository and positioned yourself inside repo in terminal.
To clone Github repository and position yourself inside `mage` folder, do the following in terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/memgraph/mage.git && cd mage
```

**1.** To build **MAGE** image run the following command:
```
docker build  -t memgraph-mage .
```
This will build any new algorithm added to MAGE, and load it inside Memgraph.

**2.** Start image with the following command and enjoy your own **MAGE**:
```
docker run --rm -p 7687:7687 --name mage memgraph-mage
```


**NOTE**: if you made any new changes while **MAGE** Docker container is running, you need to stop it and rebuild whole image,
or you can copy mage folder inside **MAGE** docker container and just do the rebuild.
Jump to [build MAGE query modules with Docker](#building-and-loading-modules-inside-memgraph-with-docker)


### 2. Installing MAGE on Linux distro from source
> Note: This step is more suitable for local development.

#### Prerequisites
* Linux based Memgraph package you can download [here](https://memgraph.com/download). We offer Ubuntu, Debian, Centos based Memgraph
packages. To install, proceed to the following [site](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/installation).
* To build and install MAGE query modules you will need: **Python3**, **Make**, **CMake**, **Clang**, **UUID** and **Rust**.

Since Memgraph needs to load MAGE's modules, there is the `setup` script to help you.


Run the `build` command of the `setup` script. It will generate a `mage/dist` directory with all the `*.so` and `*.py` files.
Flag `-p (--path)`  represents where will contents of `mage/dist` directory be copied. You need to copy it to
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` directory, because that's where Memgraph is looking for query modules by
[default](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/reference-guide/configuration/).

```
python3 setup build -p /usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules
```
> Note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup so if your instance was already running you will need to
> execute the following query inside one of [querying platforms](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph) to load them:

```
CALL mg.load_all();
```

## Running the MAGE
If we have a graph that is broken into multiple components (left image), simple call this MAGE spell to check out which node is in which components (right image) â†’

```
// Create graph as on image below

CALL weakly_connected_components.get() YIELD node, component_id
RETURN node, component_id;
```

## Advanced configuration

### 1. Automatic setup of query_module directory and build
By running following command, this script will change default directory where Memgraph is looking for query modules to your
`mage/dist` directory, and run `build` command to prepare `*.so` and `*.py` files.

```
python3 setup all
```
> Note: If your changes are not loaded, make sure to restart the instance by running `systemctl stop memgraph` and `systemctl start memgraph`.

Next time you change something, just run the following command, since it is we have already set up new directory for
query modules directory:

```
python3 setup build
```
> Note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup so if your instance was already running you will need to
> execute the following query inside one of [querying platforms](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph) to load them:


### 2. Set different query_modules directory
`setup` script offers you to set your local `mage/dist` folder as  default one for Memgraph configuration file
(flag `--query-modules-directory` defined in `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf` file with following step:

```
python3 setup modules_storage
```

This way Memgraph will be looking for query modules inside `mage/dist` folder. Now you don't need to copy `mage/dist` folder to
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` every time when you do `build`.

Now you can run only following command to build MAGE modules:
```
python3 setup build
```

> Again the note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup so if your instance was already running you will need to
> execute the following query inside one of [querying platforms](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph) to load them:
```
CALL mg.load_all();
```

## Developing MAGE with Docker

When you developed your own query module, you need to load it inside Memgraph running inside Docker container.

There are two options here.

### 1. Rebuild whole MAGE image

This command will trigger rebuild of whole Docker image. Make sure that you have added Python requirements inside `python/requirements.txt`
file.

**1.** Firstly, do the build of **MAGE** image:

```
docker build -t memgraph-mage .
```

**2.** Now, start `memgraph-mage` image with the following command and enjoy **your** own **MAGE**:
```
docker run --rm -p 7687:7687 --name mage memgraph-mage
```

### 2. Build inside Docker container

You can build **MAGE** Docker image equipped for development. `Rust`, `Clang`, `Python3-pip`, and everything else necessary
for development will still be inside the running container. This means that you can copy **MAGE** repository inside the container
and do build inside `mage` container. And there is no need to do the whole Docker image build again.

**1.** To create `dev` **MAGE** image, run the following command:

```
docker build --target dev -t memgraph-mage:dev .
```
**2.** Now run the image with following command:

```
docker run --rm -p 7687:7687 --name mage memgraph-mage:dev
```

**3.** Now copying files inside  container and doing build.

**a)** First you need to copy files to container with name `mage`

```
docker cp . mage:/mage/
```

**b)** Then you need to position yourself inside container as root:

```
docker exec -u root -it mage /bin/bash
```

> Note: if you have done build locally, make sure to delete folder `cpp/build` because
> you might be dealing with different `architectures` or problems with `CMakeCache.txt`.
> To delete it, run:
>
> `rm -rf cpp/build`

**c)** After that, run build and copying `mage/dist` to `/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`:

```
python3 setup build -p /usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules/
```
**d)** Everything is done now. Just run following command:

```
exit
```

> Note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup so if your instance was already running you will need to
> execute the following query inside one of [querying platforms](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph) to load them:
```
CALL mg.load_all();
```

## Testing the MAGE
To test that everything is built, loaded, and working correctly, a python script can be run. Make sure that the Memgraph instance with **MAGE** is up and running.
```
# Running unit tests for C++ and Python
python3 test_unit

# Running end-to-end tests
python3 test_e2e
```

Furthermore, to test only specific end-to-end tests, you can add argument `-k` with substring referring to the algorithm that needs to be tested. To test a module named `<query_module>`, you would have to run `python3 test_e2e -k <query_module>` where `<query_module>` is the name of the specific module you want to test.
```
# Running specific end-to-end tests
python3 test_e2e -k weakly_connected_components
```
