## Memgraph Advanced Graph Extensions :crystal_ball:

This open-source repository contains all available user-defined graph analytics modules and procedures that extend the Cypher query language, written by the team behind Memgraph and its users. You can find and contribute implementations of various algorithms in multiple programming languages, all runnable inside Memgraph. This project aims to give everyone the tools they need to tackle the most challenging graph problems.

###Introduction to query modules with MAGE
Memgraph introduces the concept of [query modules](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/reference-guide/query-modules/),
user-defined procedures that extend the Cypher query language. These procedures are grouped into modules that can be loaded into Memgraph. How to run them can be seen on their official 
[documentation](https://docs.memgraph.com/mage/usage/loading-modules).
When started, Memgraph will automatically attempt to load the query modules from all `*.so` and `*.py` files it finds in the default directory defined with flag 
[--query-modules-directory](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/reference-guide/configuration/).

### Further reading
If you want more info about MAGE, check out the official [MAGE Documentation](https://docs.memgraph.com/mage/).

### Algortihm proposition
Furthermore, if you have an **algorithm proposition**, please fill in the survey on [**mage.memgraph.com**](https://mage.memgraph.com/).

## How to install?
There are two options to install MAGE. With [Docker installation](#1-installing-mage-with-docker) you only need Docker.
[To build from source](#2-installing-mage-locally-with-linux-package-of-memgraph). 
you will need **Python3**, **Make**, **CMake**, **Clang** and **Rust**. Installation with Docker is easier for quick installation
and smaller development. 

### 1. Installing MAGE with Docker


#### a) Install MAGE from Docker Hub

> Note: Here you don't need to download Github Memgraph/MAGE repository.

**1.** This command downloads image from Docker Hub and runs Memgraph with **MAGE** algorithms:
```
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

#### b) Local Build of MAGE image from Github repository
If you want to make changes on algorithms, or add your algorithm, do the following.

**0.** Make sure that you have cloned MAGE Github repository and positioned yourself inside repo in terminal.
To clone Github repository and position yourself inside `mage` folder, inside terminal and do the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/memgraph/mage.git && cd mage
```

**1.** You can build **MAGE** Docker image equipped for development, since `Rust`, `Clang` and `Python3-pip` will still be
inside running container. This means that you can copy **MAGE** repo inside container and do build inside container,
there is no need to do whole Docker image build again. To create this **MAGE** image, run the following command:
```
docker build  --target dev -t memgraph-mage:dev . 
```

**2.** Start Memgraph with the following command and enjoy your own **MAGE**:
```
docker run -p 7687:7687 --name="mage" memgraph-mage:dev 
```

This will build any new algorithm added to MAGE, and load it inside Memgraph.

> Note: if you made any new changes while Docker container is running, you need to can rebuild whole image,
> or you can copy mage folder inside docker container and just do rebuild.


### 2. Installing MAGE locally with Linux package of Memgraph
> Note: This step is more suitable for local development.

Linux based Memgraph package you can download [here](https://memgraph.com/download). We offer Ubuntu, Debian, Centos based Memgraph
packages. To install, proceed to the following [site](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/installation)

To build and install MAGE query modules you will need: **Python3**, **Make**, **CMake**, **Clang** and **Rust**.

Since Memgraph needs to load MAGE's modules, there is the
`setup` script to help you.

**1.** Run the `build` command of setup script. It will generate a `mage/dist` directory with all the `*.so` and `*.py` files.
Flag `-p (--path)`  represents where will contents of `mage/dist` directory be copied. You need to copy it to 
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` directory, because that's where Memgraph is looking for query modules by
[default](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/reference-guide/configuration/).

```
python3 setup build -p /usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules
```
> Note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup so if your instance was already running you will need to 
> execute the following query inside one of [querying platforms](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph) to load them:

```
CALL mg.load_all();
```

#### [Optional step] Set different query_modules directory
`setup` script offers you to set your local `mage/dist` folder as  default one for Memgraph configuration file
(flag `--query-modules-directory` inside `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf` with following step:

```
python3 setup modules_storage
```

This way Memgraph will be looking for query modules inside `mage/dist` folder.

Now you can run only following command to build MAGE modules:
```
python3 setup build 
```
> Again the note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup so if your instance was already running you will need to 
> execute the following query inside one of [querying platforms](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph) to load them:

If you want to find out more about loading query modules, visit [this guide](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/database-functionalities/query-modules/load-call-query-modules).

## Example
If we have a graph that is broken into multiple components (left image), simple call this MAGE spell to check out which node is in which components (right image) â†’

```
// Create graph as on image below

CALL weakly_connected_components.get() YIELD node, component
RETURN node, component;
```

## Testing the MAGE
To test that everything is built, loaded, and working correctly, a python script can be run. Make sure that the Memgraph instance with **MAGE** is up and running.
```
# Running unit tests for C++ and Python
python3 test_unit

# Running end-to-end tests
python3 test_e2e
```
