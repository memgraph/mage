## Memgraph Advanced Graph Extensions :crystal_ball:

This open-source repository contains all available user-defined graph analytics
modules and procedures that extend the Cypher query language, written by the
team behind Memgraph and its users. You can find and contribute implementations
of various algorithms in multiple programming languages, all runnable inside
Memgraph. This project aims to give everyone the tools they need to tackle the
most challenging graph problems.

### Introduction to query modules with MAGE

Memgraph introduces the concept of [query
modules](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/reference-guide/query-modules/),
user-defined procedures that extend the Cypher query language. These procedures
are grouped into modules that can be loaded into Memgraph. How to run them can
be seen on their official
[documentation](https://docs.memgraph.com/mage/usage/loading-modules). When
started, Memgraph will automatically attempt to load the query modules from all
`*.so` and `*.py` files it finds in the default directory defined with flag
[--query-modules-directory](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/reference-guide/configuration/).

## Memgraph compatibility

With changes in Memgraph API, MAGE started to track version numbers. The table
below lists the compatibility of MAGE with Memgraph versions.
| MAGE version | Memgraph version |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| >= 1.4 | >= 2.4.0 |
| >= 1.0 | >= 2.0.0 |
| ^0 | >= 1.4.0 <= 1.6.1 |

## How to install MAGE?

There are two options to install MAGE. For the [Docker
installation](#1-installing-mage-with-docker), you only need Docker installed.
[To build from
source](#2-installing-mage-locally-with-linux-package-of-memgraph), you will
need **Python3**, **Make**, **CMake**, **Clang**, **UUID** and **Rust**.

After the installation, you will be ready to query Memgraph and use MAGE
modules. Make sure to have one of [the querying
platforms](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph/) installed as
well.

### 1. Installing MAGE with Docker

#### a) Install MAGE from Docker Hub

**1.** This command downloads the image from Docker Hub and runs Memgraph
preloaded with **MAGE** modules:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

#### b) Install MAGE with Docker build of the repository

**0.** Make sure that you have cloned the MAGE Github repository and positioned
yourself inside the repo in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/memgraph/mage.git && cd mage
```

**1.** To build the **MAGE** image run the following command:

```
docker build  -t memgraph-mage .
```

This will build any new algorithm added to MAGE, and load it inside Memgraph.

**2.** Start the container with the following command and enjoy Memgraph with
**MAGE**:

```
docker run --rm -p 7687:7687 --name mage memgraph-mage
```

**NOTE**: if you made any changes while the **MAGE** Docker container was
running, you will need to stop it and rebuild the whole image, or you can copy
the `mage` directory inside the Docker container and do the rebuild from there.
To learn more about development with MAGE and Docker, visit the
[documentation](https://memgraph.com/docs/mage/installation).

### 2. Installing MAGE on Linux distro from source

> Note: This step is more suitable for local development.

#### Prerequisites

- Linux based Memgraph package you can download
  [here](https://memgraph.com/download). We offer Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS
  based Memgraph packages. To install, proceed to the following
  [site](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/installation).
- To build and install MAGE query modules you will need: **Python3**, **Make**,
  **CMake**, **Clang**, **UUID** and **Rust**.

Since Memgraph needs to load MAGE's modules, there is the `setup` script to help
you.

Run the `build` command of the `setup` script. It will generate a `mage/dist`
directory with all the `*.so` and `*.py` files. Flag `-p (--path)` represents
where will contents of `mage/dist` directory be copied. You need to copy it to
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` directory, because that's where Memgraph is
looking for query modules by
[default](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/reference-guide/configuration/).

```
python3 setup build -p /usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules
```

> Note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup so if your
> instance was already running you will need to execute the following query
> inside one of the [querying
> platforms](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph) to load
> them: `CALL mg.load_all();`

## Running MAGE

This is an example of running the PageRank algorithm on a simple graph. You can
find more details on the [documentation
page](https://memgraph.com/docs/mage/query-modules/cpp/pagerank#example).

```
// Create the graph from the image below

CALL pagerank.get()
YIELD node, rank;
```

## Advanced configuration

- [Advanced query module directories
  setup](https://memgraph.com/docs/mage/installation/source#advanced-configuration)
- [Developing MAGE with
  Docker](https://memgraph.com/docs/mage/installation/docker-build#developing-mage-with-docker)

## Testing MAGE

To test that everything is built, loaded, and working correctly, a python script
can be run. Make sure that the Memgraph instance with **MAGE** is up and
running.

```
# Running unit tests for C++ and Python
python3 test_unit

# Running end-to-end tests
python3 test_e2e
```

Furthermore, to test only specific end-to-end tests, you can add argument `-k`
with substring referring to the algorithm that needs to be tested. To test a
module named `<query_module>`, you would have to run `python3 test_e2e -k <query_module>` where `<query_module>` is the name of the specific module you
want to test.

```
# Running specific end-to-end tests
python3 test_e2e -k weakly_connected_components
```
