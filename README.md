## Memgraph Advanced Graph Extensions :crystal_ball:

This open-source repository contains all available user-defined graph analytics modules and procedures that extend the Cypher query language, written by the team behind Memgraph and its users. You can find and contribute implementations of various algorithms in multiple programming languages, all runnable inside Memgraph. This project aims to give everyone the tools they need to tackle the most challenging graph problems.

###Introduction to query modules with MAGE
Memgraph introduces the concept of [query modules](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/reference-guide/query-modules/),
user-defined procedures that extend the Cypher query language. These procedures are grouped into modules that can be loaded into Memgraph. How to run them can be seen on their official 
[documentation](https://docs.memgraph.com/mage/usage/loading-modules).
When started, Memgraph will automatically attempt to load the query modules from all `*.so` and `*.py` files it finds in the default directory defined with flag 
[--query-modules-directory](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/reference-guide/configuration/).

### Further reading
If you want more info about MAGE, check out the official [MAGE Documentation](https://docs.memgraph.com/mage/).

### Algortihm proposition
Furthermore, if you have an **algorithm proposition**, please fill in the survey on [**mage.memgraph.com**](https://mage.memgraph.com/).

## How to install?

To build and install MAGE query modules you will need: **Python3**, **Make**, **CMake**, **Clang** and **Rust**. 
Also, you will need a runnable Memgraph instance, whether locally or via Docker image. 
There are few options to [download](https://memgraph.com/download), and [install](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/getting-started/installation/) **Memgraph**
depending on MAGE installation preferences.

### 1. Installing MAGE with Docker image of Memgraph 
For this part you will need Docker image of Memgraph.

**Make sure to have `memgraph:latest` Docker image with following command:**

```shell
docker inspect memgraph
```


#### a) Install MAGE with Docker Hub

**1.** This command downloads and runs Memgraph image with **MAGE** algorithms:
```
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-mage
```
This command will make use of your `memgraph:latest` image, download MAGE algorithms from Docker hub
and add them to query modules directory, so they can be loaded with Memgraph.

> Note: If you made any changes in directory on MAGE's algorithms, you should use b) option - Local Build of MAGE image
#### b) Local Build of MAGE image from cloned repo

Make sure that you have cloned MAGE Github repo and positioned yourself inside repo in terminal.

**1.** Build **MAGE** Docker image with following command:
```
docker build . -t memgraph-mage
```

**2.** Start Memgraph with the following command and enjoy **MAGE**:
```
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph-mage
```

This will build any new algorithm added to MAGE, and load it inside Memgraph.

### 2. Installing MAGE locally with Linux package of Memgraph

In second option to run MAGE, you need Linux based Memgraph. Since Memgraph needs to load MAGE's modules, there is the
`setup` script to help you.

**1.** Run the `build` command of setup script. It will generate a `mage/dist` directory with all the `*.so` and `*.py` files.
Flag `-p (--path)`  represents where will contents of `mage/dist` directory be copied. You need to copy it to 
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` directory, because that's where Memgraph is looking for query modules by
[default](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/reference-guide/configuration/).

```
python3 setup build -p /usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules
```
> Note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup so if your instance was already running you will need to 
> execute the following query inside one of [querying platforms](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph) to load them:
```
CALL mg.load_all();
```

#### [Optional step] Set different query_modules directory
`setup` script offers you to set your local `mage/dist` folder as  default `--query-modules-directory` with following step:
```
python3 setup modules_storage
```

This way Memgraph will be looking for query modules inside `mage/dist` folder.

Now you can run only following command to build MAGE modules:
```
python3 setup build 
```

If you want to find out more about loading query modules, visit [this guide](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/database-functionalities/query-modules/load-call-query-modules).

## Example
If we have a graph that is broken into multiple components (left image), simple call this MAGE spell to check out which node is in which components (right image) â†’

```
// Create graph as on image below

CALL weakly_connected_components.get() YIELD node, component
RETURN node, component;
```

## Testing the MAGE
To test that everything is built, loaded, and working correctly, a python script can be run. Make sure that the Memgraph instance with **MAGE** is up and running.
```
# Running unit tests for C++ and Python
python3 test_unit

# Running end-to-end tests
python3 test_e2e
```
