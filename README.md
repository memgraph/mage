# MAGE - Memgraph Advanced Graph Extensions :crystal_ball:

This open-source repository contains all available query modules written by the team behind Memgraph and its users. You can find and contribute implementations of various algorithms in multiple programming languages, all runnable inside Memgraph. This project aims to give everyone the tools they need to tackle the most challenging graph problems. 

## MAGE Query modules

Memgraph introduces the concept of **query modules**, user-defined procedures that extend the Cypher query language. These procedures are grouped into modules that can be loaded into Memgraph. You can find more information on query modules in the official [documentation](https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/database-functionalities/query-modules).

Query modules implemented in Python:
* [wcc.py](python/wcc.py): The WCC (Weakly Connected Components) query module can run WCC analysis on a sub-graph of the whole graph.
* [graph_analyzer.py](python/graph_analyzer.py): This Graph Analyzer query module offers insights about the stored graph or a subgraph.
* [nxalg](python/nxalg.py): A module that provides NetworkX integration with Memgraph and implements many NetworkX algorithms.  

Query modules implemented in C/C++:
* [connectivity_module.cpp](cpp/connectivity_module/connectivity_module.cpp): A module that finds weakly connected components in a graph.

## How to install?

To build and install MAGE query modules you will need: **Make**, **CMake** and **Clang**.

### Installing with Docker

**1.** Run the `build.sh` script. It will generate a `dist` directory with all the needed files.  
**2.** Start Memgraph with the following command where `$(pwd)/dist` represents the path to your newly created `dist` directory:  

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -v $(pwd)/dist:/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules memgraph
```

### Installing without Docker
**1.** Run the `build.sh` script. It will generate a `dist` directory with all the needed files.  
**2.** Copy the contents of the newly created `dist` directory to `/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`.  
**3.** Start Memgraph and enjoy **MAGE**!  

> Note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup so if your instance was already running you will need to execute the following query to load them:
```
CALL mg.load_all();
```
